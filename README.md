Our project is a Custom Programming Language Compiler with Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that allows
users to write, compile, and execute code in a custom-defined language. The compiler features lexical analysis (Flex),
parsing (Bison), AST generation, and execution capabilities. The Python-based GUI provides syntax highlighting, real-time
error reporting, AST visualization, and symbol table inspection. The system aims to offer an educational platform for
understanding compiler design principles while providing a practical development environment.
